# Zig Segmented List

This data structure was originally part of the Zig standard library, but is no longer maintained there.

This repository hosts a more recent version that also includes an unmanaged list that does not store its own allocator.

The original can be found at https://github.com/ziglang/std-lib-orphanage/.
